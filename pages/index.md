# Ratchet Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for Ratchet, a high-performance task orchestration engine written in Rust. This documentation provides comprehensive information about installing, configuring, and using Ratchet in production environments.

## What is Ratchet?

Ratchet is a production-ready JavaScript task execution platform that combines the performance and safety of Rust with the flexibility of JavaScript. It's designed to handle complex task orchestration scenarios with enterprise-grade reliability.

### Key Capabilities

- **High Performance**: Built with Rust for maximum performance and memory safety
- **JavaScript Execution**: Run JavaScript tasks in isolated, secure environments
- **Multiple APIs**: Access via GraphQL, REST, or command-line interfaces
- **Persistent Storage**: Reliable data persistence with SQLite and Sea-ORM
- **Advanced Scheduling**: Cron-based scheduling with priority queues
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling, logging, and monitoring

- [Logging & Error Handling]({{ "/logging-error-handling" | relative_url }}) - Monitor and debug your tasks

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/michiel/ratchet.git
cd ratchet

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run Ratchet
./target/release/ratchet-cli --help
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Create a Task**: Write your JavaScript task with input/output schemas
2. **Register the Task**: Place it in the task directory or register via API
3. **Execute**: Run tasks immediately or schedule them
4. **Monitor**: Track execution status and results

### Example Task

```javascript
// sample/js-tasks/weather-api/main.js
export async function handler(input) {
    const { city } = input;
    
    const response = await fetch(
        `https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?q=${city}`
    );
    
    const data = await response.json();
    
    return {
        temperature: data.current.temp_c,
        condition: data.current.condition.text,
        humidity: data.current.humidity
    };
}
```

## Architecture Highlights

Ratchet uses a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Core Engine**: Task execution and lifecycle management
- **Storage Layer**: Persistent data with migrations
- **API Layer**: GraphQL and REST endpoints
- **Worker Processes**: Isolated execution environments
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom functionality

## Use Cases

Ratchet excels in scenarios requiring:

- **Data Processing Pipelines**: ETL workflows, data transformations
- **API Integrations**: Webhook processing, third-party API orchestration
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Cron jobs, periodic maintenance tasks
- **Microservices Coordination**: Service orchestration and saga patterns
- **Event Processing**: Event-driven architectures, message processing

## Next Steps
