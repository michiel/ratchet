# Ratchet: Next Steps & Recommendations

**Priority Framework**: Stabilization → Documentation → Strategic Features → Advanced Features

## 🚨 Critical Issues (Fix This Week)

### 1. **Documentation Accuracy Crisis**
**Impact**: Users can't follow current documentation successfully  
**Effort**: 2-3 days

#### Actions Required:
- [ ] **Update CLI_USAGE.md** - Fix all command examples to match actual implementation
- [ ] **Correct ARCHITECTURE.md migration claims** - Change "MIGRATION COMPLETE" to accurate status
- [ ] **Document config commands** - Add `config validate|generate|show` documentation
- [ ] **Fix Claude Desktop setup examples** - Update configuration format

```bash
# Fix Priority Order:
1. docs/CLI_USAGE.md (lines 6, 200-214) - command examples
2. docs/CLAUDE_MCP_SETUP.md (lines 54-60) - config format  
3. docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (line 21, 135, 140-151) - migration status
4. README.md - add config commands reference
```

### 2. **Build System Reliability**
**Impact**: Multiple feature combinations fail to compile  
**Effort**: 3-4 days

#### Critical Fixes:
```rust
// Fix these compilation errors:
error[E0432]: unresolved import `InMemoryTaskExecutor`
error[E0599]: no method named `get_js_content` found  
error[E0560]: struct has no field named `version`
```

#### Actions:
- [ ] **Fix runtime feature** - Add missing InMemoryTaskExecutor import
- [ ] **Resolve API mismatches** - Create compatibility layer between ratchet-lib and ratchet-core
- [ ] **Remove broken features** - Disable feature combinations that can't be fixed quickly
- [ ] **Add CI testing** - Test all supported feature combinations

### 3. **API Compatibility Between Crates**
**Impact**: Breaking changes prevent modular migration completion  
**Effort**: 4-5 days

#### Create Compatibility Shims:
```rust
// In ratchet-core/src/compat.rs
impl Task {
    // Bridge API differences
    pub fn get_js_content(&self) -> &str {
        self.js_content()
    }
    
    // Handle metadata differences
    pub fn legacy_version(&self) -> &str {
        &self.metadata.core.version
    }
}
```

## 🎯 High Priority (Next 2 Weeks)

### 1. **Stabilize Core Features**
**Goal**: Ensure all working features remain stable during refactoring

#### Focus Areas:
- [ ] **Task execution reliability** - Add regression tests for core use cases
- [ ] **MCP server stability** - Test stdio integration end-to-end with Claude Desktop
- [ ] **Configuration system** - Validate all template generation scenarios
- [ ] **Database migrations** - Test migration path from SQLite to PostgreSQL

#### Success Metrics:
- All 486 tests continue passing
- MCP integration works with Claude Desktop
- Core CLI commands work reliably
- Configuration validation catches errors

### 2. **Simplify Feature Matrix**
**Goal**: Reduce maintenance burden by eliminating broken combinations

#### Current Feature Problems:
```toml
# These feature combinations FAIL:
features = ["minimal"]        # Missing core dependencies
features = ["runtime", "core"] # API mismatches
features = ["full"]           # Compilation errors

# Keep only WORKING combinations:
default = ["server", "database", "mcp-server", "javascript"]
minimal = ["javascript"]     # Single-task execution only
server = ["database", "rest-api", "graphql-api"]
enterprise = ["server", "mcp-server", "plugins", "monitoring"]
```

#### Actions:
- [ ] **Audit all feature combinations** - Test compilation and basic functionality
- [ ] **Remove broken features** - Disable in Cargo.toml with deprecation notice
- [ ] **Document supported features** - Clear matrix of what works
- [ ] **Update CI** - Test only supported combinations

### 3. **Complete Critical Migrations**
**Goal**: Extract essential functionality from ratchet-lib

#### Migration Priority:
1. **JavaScript execution** (ratchet-js) - Core functionality
2. **Task loading** (ratchet-core) - Essential for modular design  
3. **HTTP client integration** (ratchet-http) - Complete existing extraction

#### Strategy:
```rust
// Phase 1: Create compatibility layer
// Phase 2: Migrate one component at a time
// Phase 3: Remove deprecated ratchet-lib functions
// Phase 4: Update all imports
```

- **User validation** - Test documentation changes with real users
- **Performance monitoring** - Track performance regressions during optimization

### **Success Dependencies**
- **Clear architectural decisions** - Complete vs. stabilize modular migration
- **Feature scope control** - Resist adding new features until core is stable
- **Quality metrics** - Automated testing for all supported configurations
- **Community feedback** - Early user validation of changes

## 🏁 Immediate Next Actions (This Week)

1. **Monday**: Fix CLI_USAGE.md command examples
2. **Tuesday**: Update ARCHITECTURE.md migration status claims  
3. **Wednesday**: Document config subcommands
4. **Thursday**: Fix compilation errors for default features
5. **Friday**: Test and validate documentation changes

**Goal**: By end of week, a new user should be able to follow the documentation successfully and get Ratchet working with Claude Desktop.

**Remember**: The goal is not architectural perfection, but **user value delivery**. Ratchet's core strength (secure JavaScript task execution with LLM integration) is already production-ready. Focus on making that strength reliable and accessible rather than chasing the perfect modular architecture.
