# Legacy Deprecation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a systematic plan to deprecate and remove legacy constructs in the Ratchet codebase. During the repository synchronization implementation, several areas of technical debt and legacy code were identified that need modernization.

## Current State Analysis

### Legacy Systems Identified

#### 1. **Database Layer Duplication**
- **Legacy**: `ratchet-lib/src/database/` module with deprecated warnings
- **Modern**: `ratchet-storage` crate with `seaorm` implementation
- **Issue**: Dual database abstraction layers causing confusion and maintenance overhead
- **Impact**: HIGH - Core system functionality

#### 2. **Repository Factory Duplication**
```rust
// Legacy (deprecated)
ratchet_lib::database::repositories::RepositoryFactory

// Modern (SeaORM-based)  
ratchet_storage::seaorm::repositories::RepositoryFactory

// Abstract (interface-based)
ratchet_storage::RepositoryFactory
```

#### 3. **Server Implementation Duplication**
- **Legacy**: `serve_with_legacy_server()` in ratchet-cli
- **Modern**: `serve_with_ratchet_server()` using ratchet-server crate
- **Issue**: Fallback mechanism maintains two complete server implementations

#### 4. **Configuration Format Evolution**
- **Legacy**: `LibRatchetConfig` (ratchet-lib based)
- **Modern**: `RatchetConfig` (modular crate based)
- **Issue**: Config conversion layers and duplicate field definitions

#### 5. **Entity Model Duplication**
```rust
// Legacy (deprecated)
ratchet_lib::database::entities::{Task, Execution, Job, Schedule}

// Modern
ratchet_storage::entities::{task::Task, execution::Execution, ...}
```

## Deprecation Strategy

## Implementation Timeline

```
Week 1-2:  Phase 1 - Stabilize Modern Systems
Week 3-4:  Phase 2 - Create Migration Paths

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Areas
1. **Database Migration**: Data loss or corruption during schema migration
2. **API Compatibility**: Breaking changes affecting existing integrations
3. **Configuration**: Loss of user settings during config migration

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Backup and Rollback**: Implement automatic backup before migrations
2. **Gradual Migration**: Support both systems simultaneously during transition
3. **Extensive Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for migration paths
4. **User Communication**: Clear documentation and advance notice of changes

## Success Metrics

### Code Quality Improvements
- [ ] Reduce codebase size by ~15% (estimated 3000+ lines removed)
- [ ] Eliminate all deprecation warnings
- [ ] Achieve single-responsibility for each system component

### Performance Improvements
- [ ] Reduce server startup time (eliminate fallback overhead)
- [ ] Simplify database connection management
- [ ] Reduce memory footprint from duplicate systems

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Simplified architecture with clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Reduced cognitive load for new contributors
- [ ] Consistent patterns across all modules

## Notes

This deprecation plan addresses the technical debt identified during repository synchronization implementation. The dual database systems, server implementations, and configuration formats create maintenance overhead and confusion for developers.

The plan prioritizes user experience by maintaining backward compatibility during transition while providing clear migration paths to modern systems.

Implementation should be coordinated with regular releases to provide users adequate time to adapt to changes.
