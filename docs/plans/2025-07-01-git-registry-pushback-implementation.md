# Git Registry Push-back Implementation Plan

**Date**: 2025-07-01  
**Author**: Claude  
**Status**: Draft  
**Priority**: Medium  

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of a push-back mechanism for the ratchet-registry crate that allows changes made to tasks in the local database to be pushed back to their source Git repositories. This enables a bidirectional sync workflow where users can modify tasks locally and have those changes propagated back to the source registry.

## Background

Currently, the ratchet system supports:
- Loading tasks from Git repositories via the `GitLoader`
- Synchronizing registry tasks to the local database via `DatabaseSync`
- Modifying tasks through REST/GraphQL APIs and MCP interface
- One-way sync from Git registry to database

**Missing**: The ability to push local task modifications back to the source Git repository.

## Architecture Analysis

### Current Components

1. **Registry Loaders** (`ratchet-registry/src/loaders/`)
   - `GitLoader`: Clones, syncs, and loads tasks from Git repositories
   - Uses `gix` library for pure Rust Git operations with rustls TLS
   - Supports authentication (token, basic, SSH key, GitHub App)
   - Caches repositories locally with TTL-based sync

2. **Database Sync** (`ratchet-registry/src/sync/database.rs`)
   - Syncs discovered tasks from registry to database
   - Handles conflict resolution (UseRegistry, UseDatabase, Merge)
   - Maintains task metadata and versioning

3. **Task Management** 
   - Tasks stored in database with `registry_source: true` flag
   - Task modifications via REST/GraphQL APIs
   - MCP interface for advanced task development

### Key Gaps for Push-back

1. **No Git Write Operations**: Current `GitLoader` only performs read operations
2. **No Change Detection**: No mechanism to detect which database tasks have been modified
3. **No Commit/Push Logic**: No ability to create commits and push to remote repositories
4. **No Conflict Resolution**: No handling of push conflicts or merge scenarios

## Proposed Solution

### High-Level Architecture

```
Database Task Changes → Change Detection → Git Commit Creation → Push to Remote
     ↓                        ↓                    ↓                  ↓
Task Modification    Track Modified Tasks    Create Git Commits    Handle Conflicts
```

### Core Components

#### 1. Task Change Tracking

**New Database Fields**:
```rust
// In tasks entity
pub modified_locally: bool,           // Flag indicating local modifications
pub last_registry_sync: DateTime<Utc>, // Last sync from registry
pub local_modification_time: DateTime<Utc>, // When locally modified
pub push_status: PushStatus,          // Status of push-back operation
```

**New Push Status Enum**:
```rust
pub enum PushStatus {
    NotRequired,      // No local changes
    Pending,          // Changes ready to push
    InProgress,       // Push operation in progress
    Completed,        // Successfully pushed
    Failed(String),   // Push failed with error
    Conflict(String), // Merge conflict detected
}
```

#### 2. Git Push-back Service

**New Service**: `GitPushbackService`
```rust
pub struct GitPushbackService {
    git_client: Arc<GitClient>,
    cache: Arc<GitRepositoryCache>,
    auth_manager: Arc<GitAuthManager>,
    repository_factory: Arc<RepositoryFactory>,
    conflict_resolver: Arc<ConflictResolver>,
}
```

**Core Methods**:
- `detect_modified_tasks()` - Find tasks with local modifications
- `push_task_changes(task_id)` - Push single task changes
- `push_all_pending()` - Push all pending changes
- `handle_push_conflicts()` - Resolve push conflicts

#### 3. Git Write Operations

**Extended GitClient**:
```rust
impl GitClient {
    // New write operations
    async fn commit_task_changes(&self, repo_path: &Path, task: &Task, message: &str) -> Result<String>;
    async fn push_to_remote(&self, repo_path: &Path, branch: &str, auth: Option<&GitAuth>) -> Result<()>;
    async fn create_pull_request(&self, repo_info: &RepoInfo, branch: &str, title: &str, body: &str) -> Result<String>;
    async fn handle_merge_conflicts(&self, repo_path: &Path) -> Result<ConflictResolution>;
}
```

#### 4. Change Detection System

**Task Modification Interceptor**:
```rust
pub struct TaskModificationTracker {
    repository_factory: Arc<RepositoryFactory>,
}

impl TaskModificationTracker {
    pub async fn mark_task_modified(&self, task_id: i32) -> Result<()>;
    pub async fn get_modified_tasks(&self) -> Result<Vec<Task>>;
    pub async fn clear_modification_flag(&self, task_id: i32) -> Result<()>;
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication Management**
   - Secure storage of Git credentials
   - Token rotation and expiration handling
   - Support for multiple authentication methods

2. **Permission Controls**
   - Repository-level push permissions
   - User-based access controls
   - Audit logging for all push operations

3. **Data Validation**
   - Validate task definitions before pushing
   - Schema validation for modified tasks
   - Prevent malicious code injection

4. **Network Security**
   - TLS for all Git operations (rustls)
   - Certificate validation
   - Network timeout and retry policies

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Git operations (commit, push, conflict resolution)
   - Change tracking and detection
   - Configuration parsing and validation

2. **Integration Tests**
   - End-to-end push-back workflows
   - Multi-repository scenarios
   - Authentication with different providers

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Large repository handling
   - Batch operation performance
   - Concurrent push operations

4. **Security Tests**
   - Authentication edge cases
   - Permission boundary testing
   - Input validation and sanitization

## Rollout Plan

### Development Environment
1. Feature branch development with comprehensive testing
2. Local Git repository testing scenarios
3. Mock external Git providers for CI

### Staging Environment
1. Limited scope testing with test repositories
2. Performance benchmarking
3. Security vulnerability assessment

### Production Rollout
1. **Phase 1**: Opt-in beta for selected repositories
2. **Phase 2**: Gradual rollout with monitoring
3. **Phase 3**: Full availability with documentation

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Metrics
- Push-back operation success/failure rates
- Average time for push operations
- Conflict resolution frequency
- Repository sync lag time

### Alerting
- Failed push operations
- Authentication failures
- Repository access issues
- Conflict resolution timeouts

### Dashboards
- Push-back operation overview
- Repository health status
- Task modification patterns
- Performance trends

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Data Loss**: Incorrect Git operations could overwrite repository data
- **Authentication Issues**: Failed authentication could block operations
- **Merge Conflicts**: Complex conflicts might require manual intervention

### Medium Risk
- **Performance Impact**: Large repositories might slow operations
- **Configuration Complexity**: Multiple repositories with different settings
- **Network Dependencies**: Git operations depend on external services

### Low Risk
- **API Changes**: Extensions to existing APIs are additive
- **Database Schema**: New fields are optional and backward-compatible
- **Monitoring**: Additional metrics don't affect core functionality

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional Requirements**
   - ✅ Detect locally modified tasks
   - ✅ Push task changes to Git repositories
   - ✅ Handle merge conflicts gracefully
