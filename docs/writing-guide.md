When writing markdown documentation apply The Pyramid Principle : A Top-Down, Summary-Driven Approach

The Pyramid Principle, developed by Barbara Minto, is a communication framework designed to make complex information clear, concise, and easy to understand. Its core idea is that information should be structured like a pyramid:

 - Start with the main idea (the apex): Present your single, most important conclusion or recommendation upfront.
 - Support with key arguments (the layer below): Below the main idea, provide 2-4 key arguments or points that directly support your main conclusion. These should be distinct and logically independent.
 - Elaborate with details (the base): For each key argument, provide supporting facts, data, examples, or explanations. These details form the broad base of the pyramid.

When applied to writing Markdown, this translates into a hierarchical structure where summaries precede detailed content at every level, ensuring the reader always grasps the "so what" before diving into the "how" or "why."

## Applying the Pyramid Principle to Markdown Structure:

 1. Overall Document Summary (The Apex of Your Markdown Pyramid) - At the very top of your Markdown document, you should have a concise summary that encapsulates the entire content. This is your main conclusion, the answer to the reader's likely question, or the single most important takeaway.
 2. Section Summaries (The First Supporting Layer) Each major section of your Markdown document should begin with its own summary. This summary should directly support the overall document summary and introduce the core idea of that specific section. It acts as a mini-pyramid's apex for that section.
 3. Subsection Summaries (The Second Supporting Layer and Beyond) Following the same logic, if your sections contain subsections, each subsection should also start with a brief summary of its content. This continues the hierarchical "summary-first" approach down to the most granular level of detail.
