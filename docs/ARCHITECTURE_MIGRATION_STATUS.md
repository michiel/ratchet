# Architecture Migration Status

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of implementing the architectural improvements proposed in `docs/plans/ARCHITECTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md`.

## Phase 1: Foundation (âœ… COMPLETED)

### 1. Workspace Structure âœ…
- Created workspace with 8 new crates:
  - `ratchet-core` - Core domain models and types
  - `ratchet-runtime` - Task execution runtime
  - `ratchet-storage` - Storage abstraction
  - `ratchet-api` - Unified API layer
  - `ratchet-ipc` - Inter-process communication
  - `ratchet-resilience` - Resilience patterns
  - `ratchet-caching` - Caching abstractions
  - `ratchet-plugins` - Plugin system

### 2. Core Domain Models âœ…
Implemented in `ratchet-core`:
- **Types**: `HttpMethod`, `LogLevel`, `Priority` with proper serialization
- **Task Model**: Complete task definition with builder pattern
- **Execution Model**: Execution lifecycle with status tracking
- **Error System**: Unified error types with context and retry detection
- **Service Registry**: Dependency injection with async support

### 3. Type Safety Improvements âœ…
- Newtype pattern for IDs: `TaskId`, `ExecutionId`, `JobId`
- Type-safe builders for complex objects
- Comprehensive error types with proper categorization

## Phase 2: Modularization (âœ… COMPLETED)

### 1. Database Layer Unification âœ…
**Status**: Completed
- Successfully established ratchet-storage as the primary storage abstraction
- Created compatibility layer between ratchet-lib and ratchet-storage database types
- Updated MCP and CLI to use ratchet-storage repositories where appropriate
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

### 2. Configuration System Consolidation âœ…
**Status**: Completed  
- ratchet-config established as the primary configuration system
- Created compatibility layer in `ratchet-config/src/compat.rs` for legacy format conversion
- CLI updated to load configuration via ratchet-config
- Legacy ratchet-lib config still supported for components that need it

### 3. API Layer Decision âœ…  
**Status**: Completed - Decision: ratchet-lib remains primary
- Investigation revealed no competing API implementation 
- ratchet-lib contains the complete, working REST and GraphQL implementation
- No migration needed - consolidation already achieved

### 4. JavaScript Execution Engine âœ…
**Status**: Completed - Decision: Keep in ratchet-lib
- JS executor actively used by multiple components (CLI, MCP, services)
- ratchet-runtime version is experimental/alternative implementation  
- Current implementation working well and tested
- No immediate migration benefit identified

## Phase 3: Extensibility (ðŸ“… PLANNED)

### 1. Plugin System
- Plugin trait definition
- Dynamic loading support
- Plugin registry
- Example plugins

### 2. Feature Flags
- Add conditional compilation flags
- Separate optional dependencies
- Reduce default build size

### 3. Configuration Split
- Domain-specific config modules
- Environment variable support
- Config validation

## Phase 4: Polish (ðŸ“… PLANNED)

### 1. Testing Infrastructure
- Test utilities in each crate
- Mock implementations
- Integration test framework

### 2. Documentation
- Architecture guide updates
- Migration guide for existing code
- API documentation

### 3. Performance
- Benchmark suite
- Optimization pass
- Compilation time analysis

## Migration Strategy

### Current Approach
1. **Parallel Development**: New crates alongside existing `ratchet-lib`
2. **Incremental Migration**: Move code piece by piece
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Keep existing APIs working
4. **Test Coverage**: Ensure all tests pass after each step

### Next Steps
1. âœ… Database layer unified with ratchet-storage
2. âœ… Configuration system consolidated with ratchet-config  
3. âœ… API layer strategy decided (ratchet-lib primary)
4. âœ… JavaScript execution engine strategy decided (ratchet-lib primary)
5. **NEW**: Focus on Phase 3 - Extensibility improvements
   - Plugin system development in ratchet-plugin/ratchet-plugins
   - Feature flags and conditional compilation
   - Runtime optimization

## Benefits Realized So Far

### Code Organization âœ…
- Clear separation of concerns with dedicated crates
- Domain models isolated in `ratchet-core`
- Service registry enables better testing

### Type Safety âœ…
- Newtype IDs prevent mixing different ID types
- Builder patterns ensure valid object construction
- Comprehensive error types with context

### Foundation for Future âœ…
- Plugin system architecture ready
- Dependency injection in place
- Modular structure supports parallel development

## Migration Progress Update

- **Phase 1**: âœ… Completed (Foundation)
- **Phase 2**: âœ… Completed (Modularization)  
- **Phase 3**: ðŸ“… Ready to Start (Extensibility)
- **Phase 4**: ðŸ“… Future (Polish)

**Current Status**: ~70% complete
**Remaining Work Estimate**:
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 weeks (extensibility features)
- **Phase 4**: 1-2 weeks (polish and cleanup)

Total remaining: 3-5 weeks

## Notes

- The existing `ratchet-lib` continues to work during migration
- New features should be built in the new structure
- Gradual migration minimizes risk
- Each phase delivers value independently
