  title: Ratchet REST API
  description: |
    The Ratchet REST API provides programmatic access to manage tasks and their executions.
    
    ## Key Features
    - **Tasks**: Registry-based task definitions with input/output schemas
    - **Executions**: Create, monitor, and manage task executions
    - **Jobs**: Queue management for task execution with priorities and scheduling
    - **Schedules**: Cron-based scheduling for automated task execution
    - **Workers**: Monitor worker pool status and performance
    - **Refine.dev Compatible**: Full support for Refine.dev pagination, sorting, and filtering conventions
    - **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Consistent error responses with detailed messages
    
    ## Authentication
    Currently, the API does not require authentication. This may change in future versions.
    
    ## Pagination
    The API uses Refine.dev compatible pagination with `_start` and `_end` parameters.
    Responses include `x-total-count` and `content-range` headers.
    
    ## Error Handling
    All errors follow the Refine.dev error format with `statusCode` and `message` fields.
