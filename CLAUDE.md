- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md contains the architecture, TODO.md contains the roadmap and priorities
- This projects build one binary (ratchet), that contains all functionality and exposes this through commands and subcommands
- After all changes, ensure that the code compiles without errors and that all tests pass
- There are cargo tools available for analysis, testing, coverage reporting, dependency review, etc. use them as required and request installation of tools if they are not available
- The target platforms are Linux, macOS, and Windows. Ensure that the code is cross-platform compatible. Uses hybrid TLS: rustls for HTTP client operations, OpenSSL limited to git2 for HTTPS Git repository access
