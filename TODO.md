## üìù **Notes**

- All changes should maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Add deprecation warnings before removing existing APIs
- Update CHANGELOG.md for any user-facing changes
- Consider impact on existing task definitions and workflows
- Plan for database migrations and schema evolution
- Security should be the top priority for production deployments
- Performance testing should be conducted before large-scale deployments
