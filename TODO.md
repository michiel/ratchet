# Ratchet Development Roadmap & TODO

## 🎯 Current Status: Phase 5A Database Migration Complete! Phase 5B Output System In Progress! 🚀✅

**Latest Achievement**: Successfully completed Phase 5A database migration! All database functionality migrated from ratchet-lib to ratchet-storage with deprecation warnings and bridge adapters. Created standalone ratchet-output crate for output destination system. The workspace now consists of 22 specialized crates with comprehensive modular architecture.

**Major Milestone**: Database migration complete with bridge adapters providing seamless transition. ratchet-output crate created with full functionality including filesystem/webhook destinations, template engine, retry logic, and metrics. All tests pass, proving the migration strategy works.
