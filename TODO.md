### 🚧 What's Next:
Only the **Database Layer (#19)** remains to complete the core server functionality. The server can currently execute tasks but doesn't persist execution history or job state.

## Getting Started

**For Server Implementation:**
1. ✅ **Phase 1-3 Complete** - Server foundation is ready!
2. **Next**: Complete Database Layer (#19) for full persistence
3. **Optional**: Add authentication/authorization for production use
4. Server is **functional now** - can execute tasks via GraphQL API

**For General Development:**
1. Start with **High Priority** items to establish a solid foundation
2. Focus on one category at a time to maintain code stability
3. Write tests for each refactoring before making changes
4. Update documentation as you implement improvements
5. Consider breaking large changes into smaller, reviewable commits

## Current Codebase Analysis for Server

### Key Issues Preventing Server Implementation

1. **Tight CLI Coupling** (`ratchet-cli/src/main.rs:410-493`)
   - Task execution logic embedded in CLI command handlers
   - HTTP manager instantiated directly in CLI code
   - No service layer abstraction for reuse

2. **Hardcoded Values** (Multiple files)
   - Magic strings in js_executor.rs: `__fetch_url`, `__http_result`
   - No centralized configuration management
   - Environment-specific settings scattered throughout code

3. **Synchronous Task Loading** (`task.rs:85-100`)
   - Uses `std::fs` instead of `tokio::fs` for file operations
   - LRU cache size hardcoded to 100 entries
   - No async/await in task loading pipeline

4. **Complex Execution Function** (`js_executor.rs` - `call_js_function`)
   - Single large function handling multiple responsibilities
   - Difficult to unit test individual components
   - Hard to extract for service layer usage

5. **No Persistence Layer**
   - All task data loaded from filesystem on each execution
   - No tracking of execution history or job status
   - No support for scheduled or queued executions

### Required Dependencies for Server

**New Crates Needed:**
- `sqlx` or `sea-orm` - Database operations and migrations
- `async-graphql` - GraphQL schema and resolvers  
- `axum` or `warp` - HTTP server and routing
- `serde_yaml` - Configuration file parsing
- `tokio-cron-scheduler` - Job scheduling
- `uuid` - Already available, extend usage for job IDs

**Workspace Structure After Server Addition:**
```

├── ratchet-lib/          # Core task execution (current)
├── ratchet-cli/          # CLI interface (refactored)
├── ratchet-server/       # GraphQL server (new)
├── ratchet-db/           # Database models & migrations (new)

```

## Notes

- All changes should maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Add deprecation warnings before removing existing APIs
- Update the CHANGELOG.md for any user-facing changes
- Consider the impact on existing task definitions and user workflows
- Server implementation requires completing Foundation Refactoring first
- Plan for database migrations and schema evolution from the start
