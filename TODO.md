# Ratchet Refactoring & Improvement TODO

## Code Quality & Refactoring

### 1. Error Handling Improvements
- [x] **Extract JavaScript Error Type Generation** (`lib.rs:111-211`) ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - [x] Create macro or data structure for error types
  - [x] Implement `generate_error_class` function to reduce duplication
  - [x] Replace 200+ lines of repetitive error class definitions
  - [x] Add unit tests for error type generation
  
  **Summary**: Refactored 200+ lines of repetitive JavaScript error class definitions into a data-driven approach using `JsErrorConfig` struct and generation functions. Reduced code duplication by ~85% while maintaining the same functionality. Added comprehensive unit tests covering standard errors, status-aware errors (HttpError), and integration testing.

### 2. Function Complexity Reduction
- [ ] **Break Down `call_js_function`** (`lib.rs:253-493`)

  - [ ] Add comprehensive tests for each extracted function

### 3. Magic String Constants
- [ ] **Extract Hardcoded Variables** 
  - [ ] Create constants for `__fetch_url`, `__fetch_params`, `__fetch_body`
  - [ ] Create constants for `__http_result`, `__temp_result`
  - [ ] Create constants for common JSON schema property names
  - [ ] Update all references to use constants

  - [ ] Extract header building logic into separate function
  - [ ] Add more specific error variants for different HTTP scenarios
  - [ ] Make timeouts and other settings configurable
  - [ ] Add connection pooling for better performance
  - [ ] Add retry logic with exponential backoff

### 5. Task Loading Performance

  - [ ] Implement lazy schema validation (only when needed)
  - [ ] Replace `std::fs` with `tokio::fs` for non-blocking I/O
  - [ ] Add content streaming for large JavaScript files
  - [ ] Implement progressive loading for large task archives

### 6. CLI User Experience

  - [ ] Improve error messages with actionable suggestions
  - [ ] Add progress indicators for long-running operations
  - [ ] Implement config file support for CLI defaults

## Type Safety & Architecture

### 7. Type Safety Improvements
- [x] **Replace String-based Types** ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - [x] Create `HttpMethod` enum to replace string-based method handling
  - [x] Create `LogLevel` enum for better log level management  
  - [x] Create `TaskStatus` enum for task execution states
  - [x] Add proper type conversion methods with error handling
  
  **Summary**: Created comprehensive type-safe enums for HTTP methods, log levels, and task statuses. Replaced string-based method handling throughout the HTTP module with strongly-typed `HttpMethod` enum. Added proper error handling, serialization support, and conversion methods. Maintained backward compatibility while providing safer, more maintainable APIs.

### 8. Plugin Architecture
- [ ] **Implement TaskExecutor Trait**
  - [ ] Design `TaskExecutor` trait interface
  - [ ] Extract JavaScript execution into trait implementation
  - [ ] Add support for multiple execution engines

### 9. Configuration Management
- [ ] **Centralized Configuration**
  - [ ] Create `RatchetConfig` struct with all settings
  - [ ] Implement configuration loading from files and environment
  - [ ] Add configuration validation
  - [ ] Support for profile-based configurations (dev, test, prod)

### 10. Module Organization
- [ ] **Better Code Structure**
  - [ ] Move recording functionality to `ratchet-lib/src/recording/` module
  - [ ] Split `lib.rs` (954 lines) into smaller focused modules
  - [ ] Create dedicated `error.rs` for all error types
  - [ ] Organize HTTP-related code into submodules
  - [ ] Create `validation/` module for schema validation logic

## Performance Optimizations

### 11. Memory Management
- [ ] **Optimize Memory Usage**
  - [ ] Make LRU cache size configurable (`task.rs:23`)
  - [ ] Implement automatic content purging based on usage patterns
  - [ ] Add memory usage monitoring and reporting
  - [ ] Implement memory limits and cleanup strategies

### 12. Execution Performance
- [ ] **Batch Operations**
  - [ ] Combine multiple schema validations into single operations
  - [ ] Implement parallel test execution for test suites
  - [ ] Add compilation caching for JavaScript functions
  - [ ] Optimize JSON parsing and serialization

### 13. Concurrency Improvements
- [ ] **Better Async Handling**
  - [ ] Review and optimize async/await usage patterns
  - [ ] Implement proper cancellation support
  - [ ] Add timeout handling for all async operations
  - [ ] Use `tokio::spawn` for independent concurrent tasks

## Developer Experience

## Getting Started

1. Start with **High Priority** items to establish a solid foundation
2. Focus on one category at a time to maintain code stability
3. Write tests for each refactoring before making changes
4. Update documentation as you implement improvements
5. Consider breaking large changes into smaller, reviewable commits

## Notes

- All changes should maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Add deprecation warnings before removing existing APIs
- Update the CHANGELOG.md for any user-facing changes
- Consider the impact on existing task definitions and user workflows
