   - Migrate core functionality from ratchet-lib to ratchet-api
   - Test compatibility with existing API contracts

3. **Production Features**
   - Add authentication middleware integration points
   - Implement security headers and enhanced validation
   - Set up monitoring endpoints and metrics collection
   - Create comprehensive API documentation

### **Priority 2: Authentication Implementation** (After MCP & API Server)
1. **Create Authentication System**
   ```rust
   // Files to create in ratchet-api:
   ratchet-api/src/middleware/auth.rs    // JWT validation middleware
   ratchet-api/src/handlers/auth.rs      // Login/logout endpoints  
   ratchet-storage/src/entities/user.rs  // User entity
   ratchet-storage/src/entities/api_key.rs // API key entity
   ```

2. **Database Schema Updates**
   - Add users and API keys tables in ratchet-storage
   - Create migration for authentication tables
   - Update existing entities with user relationships

3. **API Security Integration**
   - Protect sensitive endpoints with authentication
   - Add user context to GraphQL resolvers
   - Implement proper error handling for auth failures

### **Priority 3: Production Configuration**
1. **Enhanced Configuration**
   ```rust
   pub struct SecurityConfig {
       pub enable_https: bool,
       pub cert_path: Option<PathBuf>,
       pub key_path: Option<PathBuf>,
       pub session_timeout: Duration,
       pub jwt_secret: String,
   }
   ```

2. **Docker Deployment**
   - Create production Dockerfile
   - Docker Compose for development
   - Environment variable documentation

## 📋 **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) To Create**

### **Critical Priority (Phase 0)**
1. **REST/GraphQL Implementation Strategy**: ratchet-lib migration vs ratchet-api unified approach
2. **Dependency Management Strategy**: Workspace vs per-crate versions, upgrade timeline
3. **API Server Migration**: Big-bang vs gradual vs feature-flag driven approach

### **High Priority (Phase 1)**
4. **Authentication Strategy**: JWT vs Sessions vs API Keys vs OAuth2
5. **API Evolution**: Versioning strategy and backward compatibility
6. **Security Architecture**: Middleware stack design and plugin integration

### **Medium Priority (Future Phases)**
7. **Database Scaling**: Future PostgreSQL migration strategy and sharding for enterprise scale
8. **Distributed Architecture**: Service discovery and communication patterns
9. **Container Strategy**: Docker vs Podman vs native execution
10. **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus + Grafana vs ELK vs cloud solutions
11. **Message Queue**: Redis vs RabbitMQ vs Apache Kafka for job distribution
12. **Multi-tenancy**: Data isolation and resource management approach

## 🔍 **Current Codebase Health**

### **Metrics** ✅ **EXCELLENT**
- **Tests**: 46+ plugin tests passing, comprehensive coverage across 7 crates
- **Compilation**: Clean workspace build (0 errors, minor warnings only)
- **Architecture**: **Modular architecture complete** with 7 specialized crates
- **Plugin System**: Full lifecycle management with 46+ passing tests
- **Code Quality**: Repository pattern, unified error handling, type safety

### **Technical Debt** 🟡 **LOW**
- Some unused imports (11 warnings) - easily fixable
- Magic strings could be extracted to constants
- Some complex functions could benefit from further breakdown
- Documentation could be expanded for new features

### **Security Status** ⚠️ **NEEDS ATTENTION**
- ❌ No authentication system (all endpoints public)
- ✅ SQL injection prevention implemented
- ✅ Rate limiting system in place
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ⚠️ JWT configuration present but not implemented

---

## 🚀 **Ready for Production with Caveats**

**Current State**: The Ratchet server is **functionally complete** and ready for production use with the following considerations:

### **Production Ready** ✅
- Complete GraphQL and REST APIs
- Persistent database storage
- Job queue and scheduling
- Worker process management
- Configuration management
- Rate limiting and basic security

### **Requires Attention for Production** ⚠️
- **Authentication system** (highest priority)
- **HTTPS/TLS configuration**
- **Production database optimization** (SQLite tuning and future database strategy)
- **Monitoring and alerting**
- **Backup and recovery procedures**

### **Quick Start for Development**
```bash
# Start development server
ratchet serve

# Start with custom configuration  
ratchet serve --config=example-config.yaml

# Access GraphQL playground
open http://localhost:8080/playground
```

## 📝 **Notes**

- All changes should maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Add deprecation warnings before removing existing APIs
- Update CHANGELOG.md for any user-facing changes
- Consider impact on existing task definitions and workflows
- Plan for database migrations and schema evolution
- Security should be the top priority for production deployments
- Performance testing should be conducted before large-scale deployments
